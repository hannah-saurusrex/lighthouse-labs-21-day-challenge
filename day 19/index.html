    <p>Each item differs in both cost and the grams of pumpkin spice per serving. 
        To help festival-goers maximize their pumpkin spice consumption, help them determine the maximum amount of 
        pumpkin spice they can ingest with the amount of money they are bringing to the festival.
        <ul>
            <li>A slice of pumpkin pie costs $5 each, and include a whopping 30g of pumpkin spice</li>
            <li>Pumpkin spice lattes cost $3 each, and include 15g of pumpkin spice</li>
            <li>Pumpkin spice macarons cost $1 each, and include 3g of pumpkin spice</li>
