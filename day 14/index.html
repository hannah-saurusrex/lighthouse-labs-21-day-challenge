    <p>We'll be implementing a function called dynamicPricing(), which will return the cost of a particular trip given the number of people on the bus, 
        and the distance traveled by the passenger. 
        This function receives two numbers: numberOfPeople and distanceTraveled.</p>
    <p>The base ticket price is $1. Passengers will be charged $0.25 per kilometer. If there are 30 or more people on the bus, 
        there should be $0.25 added to the total.</p>
    <p>The value that your functions returns must be a string, formatted as such: $4.25. Your values must be shown to two decimal points of precision.</p>
