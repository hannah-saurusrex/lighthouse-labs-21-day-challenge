    <p>To make late-night driving and walking safer (and to save the city energy), you've decided to install smart street lights. <br>
        These lights turn on and off automatically when they sense someone near by.<br>
        You'll need to use JavaScript to create some of the functionality to control the lights.<br>
        We will be implementing this using three functions. 
        The first two functions will receive an array of objects that represent street lights which may be on or off.</p>
    <p>
        -Our first function, lightsOn, must set all of the lights to on and then return the array of lights.<br>
        -The second function, lightsOff, must set all the lights to "off" and then return the array of lights.<br>
        -The third function, toggleLights, will receive an array of many street lights, as well as a boolean value<br>
        lightsAreOn which tells you whether or not all the lights are currently on. If lightsAreOn is true, your function should <br>
        turn all of the lights off. If lightsAreOn is false, your function should turn all of the lights on.
