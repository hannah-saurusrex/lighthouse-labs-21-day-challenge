    <p>For this challenge, we'll need to implement a function called judgeVegetable()that will decide which vegetable is best 
        based on a given judging characteristic. Our function will receive two parameters: a list of veggies(as an array of objects), 
        and a characteristic to judge the veggies by (in the case of a tomato, either redness or plumpness).<br>
        Our function must return the name of the person who submitted (vegetables.submitter) the vegetable with the highest ranking in 
        the provided category.</p>
